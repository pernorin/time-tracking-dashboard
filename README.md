## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- SCSS
- JavaScript
- BEM-naming
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### Things I did

- I used radio buttons for the timeframe selector and then styled them to only show the name of the timeframe. This is an easy way to both get the right function when the user interacts with the selector and to access the value in the JavaScript.
- I used SCSS for the CSS and BEM for naming classes.
- For the main layout I used CSS grid, making a 4 column/3 column/1 column responsive design.
- I struggled a bit with the JavaScript, but I got it right in the end.

### Useful resources

- [getbem.com](http://getbem.com/naming/) - A site that explains using the BEM-method for naming classes to get better structured CSS-files.
